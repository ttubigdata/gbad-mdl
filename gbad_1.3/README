RELEASE NOTES

Version 1.3

- Fixed GBAD-P algorithm such that it now outputs ALL instances that have
  the same anomalous score, rather than just the first one that is most
  anomalous.
- Fixed bug in FlagAnomalousVerticesAndEdges (existed in all previous versions of GBAD).

Version 1.2

- Re-implemented GBAD-MDL algorithm so that it now is more like the actual 
  algorithm, and is more accurate in reporting the normative pattern.  The basic
  change was to use a threshold of 0.0 when searching for the normative pattern,
  then using the -mdl threshold to find those non-normative substructures that 
  are closest to the normative pattern without matching exactly (and are under 
  the user-specified -mdl threshold).
- For the GBAD-MPS algorithm, an entire instance is anomalous.  So, changed the
  reporting the anomaly to report the complete instance and not report any
  individual vertices or edges as anomalies.

Version 1.1

- Fix to matching on SUB_# when using the GBAD-P approach
- Addition of tracking so that across multiple iterations (like with GBAD-P) we will know what the original vertex and example (XP) numbers were.
