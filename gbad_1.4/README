RELEASE NOTES

Version 1.4

- Modified GBAD-P algorithm so that it now goes off of the best substructure
  at each iteration, rather than continually going off of the most anomalous
  substructure.
- Fixed bug in GBAD-P logic that was incorrectly calculating the number of
  instances, and thus affecting the probabilistic score.
- Changed logic to allow for anlyzing edges that go between two SUB_#
  substructures that are the same (e.g., an edge between a SUB_1 and a SUB_1).
  Also, now accepting single vertices, thus allowing for the scenario of
  a self-edge from a SUB_#.
- Added code in compress.c to check that the file that needs to be created
  can be created.

Version 1.3

- Fixed GBAD-P algorithm such that it now outputs ALL instances that have
  the same anomalous score, rather than just the first one that is most
  anomalous.
- Fixed bug in FlagAnomalousVerticesAndEdges (existed in all previous versions 
  of GBAD).

Version 1.2

- Re-implemented GBAD-MDL algorithm so that it now is more like the actual 
  algorithm, and is more accurate in reporting the normative pattern.  The basic
  change was to use a threshold of 0.0 when searching for the normative pattern,
  then using the -mdl threshold to find those non-normative substructures that 
  are closest to the normative pattern without matching exactly (and are under 
  the user-specified -mdl threshold).
- For the GBAD-MPS algorithm, an entire instance is anomalous.  So, changed the
  reporting the anomaly to report the complete instance and not report any
  individual vertices or edges as anomalies.

(NOTE:  The version before this one, between 1.1 and 1.2, is actually stored in 
        the directory src_062708.)

Version 1.1

- Fix to matching on SUB_# when using the GBAD-P approach
- Addition of tracking so that across multiple iterations (like with GBAD-P) we 
  will know what the original vertex and example (XP) numbers were.
